# Final Project: Web Scraping Application

## Objective

The objective of this final project is to apply the concepts learned throughout the course on web scraping. Students will create a comprehensive web scraping application that demonstrates their understanding of various scraping techniques, data extraction methods, and data storage practices.

## Project Overview

Students will choose a website of their choice (please ensure that the website allows web scraping according to its `robots.txt`) and develop a web scraper that extracts useful data. This application should be built using Python and should utilize libraries such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium as appropriate.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Choose a Target Website
- Select a website that provides relevant data for scraping.
- Ensure that the scraping complies with the website's `robots.txt` restrictions.

### 2. Define the Data to Extract
- Identify specific elements on the webpage that you want to scrape (e.g., product names, prices, descriptions, etc.).
- Document the structure of the webpage (HTML elements' IDs, classes, etc.) and what data you will extract.

### 3. Set Up Your Scraping Environment
- Create a virtual environment for your project.
- Install necessary libraries (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Requests, etc.).

### 4. Develop the Scraper
- Implement a web scraper that can navigate through the target website's pages.
- Use CSS selectors or XPath to extract the required data efficiently.
- Handle potential issues such as pagination, dynamic content, or loading times.

### 5. Data Storage
- Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database (e.g., SQLite or MongoDB).
- Ensure that the data is clean and well-organized.

### 6. Document Your Process
- Write a comprehensive report detailing:
  - The target website and the permissions to scrape it.
  - The data extraction goals.
  - The technologies and libraries used.
  - The challenges faced and how they were resolved.
  - Examples of the scraped data.

### 7. Presentation
- Prepare a presentation to showcase your project, including:
  - Live demonstration of your scraper.
  - Discussion of the data collected and its potential uses.
  - Lessons learned during the scraping process.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness: Does the project meet all requirements?
- Functionality: Does the web scraper work as intended without errors?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, commented, and adheres to Python best practices?
- Presentation: Is the final presentation clear, engaging, and informative?

## Submission

- Submit your code in a GitHub repository.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the scraper.
- Submit the report as a PDF documenting your scraping process and findings.

Good luck, and enjoy the process of building your web scraping application!
